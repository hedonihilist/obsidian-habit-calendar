## Obsidian Habit Calendar Plugin

Monthly Habit Calendar for DataviewJS. 

This plugin helps you render a calendar inside DataviewJS code block, showing your habit status within a month. It's based on the [Habit Track](https://github.com/duoani/obsidian-habit-tracker) plugin by [@duoani](https://github.com/duoani).


## How To

This plugin is intended to be used alongside [DataviewJS](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/). All you need to do is prepare the data and call `renderHabitCalendar` in a dataviewjs code block.

### Basic Usage

~~~
```dataviewjs
renderHabitCalendar(this.container, {
  year: 2023,
  month: 1,
  entries: [{
    date: '2023-01-01',
    content: '‚≠ê'
  }, {
    date: '2023-01-03',
    content: '‚≠ê'
  }]
})
```
~~~

The above code will be rendered like this:

![simple](images/simple.png)

If your daily note is of `YYYY-MM-DD` format, the calendar will be associated with your daily note automatically. You can hover over the number or click the number to access the corresponding note.

### Customize link

In case you have a different daily note format or want to customize linking, just pass in the link of each entry.

Say your daily notes are named like `2023Âπ¥01Êúà01Êó•.md`, all you need to do is add the `link` field and set to `2023Âπ¥01Âπ¥01Êó•`:

~~~
```
renderHabitCalendar(this.container, {
  year: 2023,
  month: 1,
  entries: [{
    date: '2023-01-01',
    content: '‚≠ê',
    link: '2023Âπ¥01Êúà01Êó•'  // like this line
  }, {
    date: '2023-01-03',
    content: '‚≠ê',
    link: '2023Âπ¥01Êúà03Êó•'
  }]
})
```
~~~


### Fill Calendar with HTML

Want to fill the calendar with HTML? Here we go:

~~~
```dataviewjs
renderHabitCalendar(this.container, {
  year: 2023,
  month: 1,
  format: 'html',   // set the format to html
  entries: [{
    date: '2023-01-01',
    content: '<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>'
  }, {
    date: '2023-01-03',
    content: '‚≠ê',
  }]
})
```
~~~

**Note:** don't forget to enable the HTML in the plugin settings.

### Fill Calendar with Markdown

If you don't want to write html, write markdown then. 

~~~
```dataviewjs
renderHabitCalendar(this.container, {
  year: 2023,
  month: 1,
  format: 'markdown',   // don't forget to change the format~
  entries: [{
    date: '2023-01-01',
    content: '[Google](https://www.google.com)'
  }, {
    date: '2023-01-03',
    content: '‚≠ê',
  }],
  filepath: dv.current().file.path  // also add this line
})
```
~~~

**Note1:** Sometimes the markdown text is not rendered correctly. Try switching to other files and switching back.

**Note2:** the `filepath` is the path of the file where dataviewjs code lies. If the markdown text contains some relative link, you should input this field.

### Detailed Usage

The first argument should be the html container in which the calendar will be created. Most of the time, `this.container` will do.

You can pass the habit data through the second argument. The following fields are supported:

- `year`: year of the calendar, apparently
- `month`: month of the calendar
- `entries`: a list of entries containing the habit data per day. A entry contains
    - `date`: date of the habit
    - `content`: whatever you want to put in the calendar
    - `link`: the file you want the entry to link to, just pass in the text inside `[[]]`. For example, if the original obsidian link is `[[2023-01-01]]`, pass in `2023-01-01`.
- `format`: the way you want `entries[i].content` to be rendered. Choose `html` or `markdown` to render as html or markdown, make sure their cooresopnding settings are enabled in the settings tab. Leave empty to treat the content as plain text.
- `filepath`: if you want to render the content as markdown, pass the current file path thru this field.

## How I record my habits



Check out the [example vault](https://github.com/hedonihilist/obsidian-habit-calendar/tree/master/ExampleVault). Your habits can look like this

### Add habit templates

In your diary template, add some habits you'd like to track:

~~~
```
## habits

- [ ] #habit read for (reading:: 30) minutes
- [ ] #habit jog for (jogging:: 30) minutes
- [ ] #habit get up before 8:00 am (wakey:: true)
```
~~~

Here we use `#habit` tag to distinguish habits from normal tasks and use Dataview attributes to record the intensity of the habit.

### Record habit

Once you completed a habit, check the corresponding habit in your diary.

### View your habits

Use dataviewjs to query the accomplished habits and pass the data to `renderHabitCalendar`. The following code will query the days you did some reading.

~~~
```
let files = dv.pages(`"diarys"`)
let data = []
for (let file of files) {
	console.log(file)
	for (let task of file.file.tasks) {
		if (task.tags.contains('#habit') && task.checked && task.reading) { // select only checked habits
			data.push({date: file.file.name, content: `üìñ ${task.reading} min`})
		}
	} 
}
renderHabitCalendar(this.container, {year: 2023, month: 2, entries: data, filepath: dv.current().file.path, width: "100%"}) 
```
